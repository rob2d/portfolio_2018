            I have deployed 8 front-end projects since late 2016 with it. It was used to create a
            decent starting point for several very high profile projects that I am aware of, such
            as <a href={ '/projects/smartwalk' }>an engineering app</a> to support most of the Fortune 500
            company-housed skyscrapers in NYC today as well as the official newspaper for a top
            highschool in the US (
            <a href={ 'http://www.stuyspec.com' } target={ '_new' }>
                http://www.stuyspec.com</a>). It was also used
            to spin up much less
            high profile/ground-shaking projects -- such as this portfolio!

            Note that I don't actually still use this for my own projects anymore, as build tools
            beginning around Webpack 4 have finally begun to include lots of features that make this
            irrelevant. Beyond that some things I do such as writing tests, using Typescript, etc
            which go beyond the scope of what I was doing when I began using it.
