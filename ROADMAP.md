# ROADMAP #
## [ Roadmap All the Things â„¢ ] ##

Migrating to Github Issues now that that has improved quite a bit since this was started in early 2017, but for things not yet listed that are lower priority or random notes, this is a good backup resource.

## Projects
- Use vertical space a bit better in the Details layout on wide screens.

## Misc
- auto-generate sitemap.xml using react-router library.
- generate meta data for content on serverside (possibly integrated with point right above).

## Nice-to-haves

- allow filtering of techs in Projects view.
- Add a React hook for routing + classNames to create nice section.
scroll left/right transitions.
- Code preview button for each section.
